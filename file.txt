Hi, Spring fans! You're awesome! I know you're awesome. You know you're awesome. 
And the Spring team works for you. 
We like working for you because you dream awesome dreams and build awesome things. 
And we can't work effectively with and for you if we don't know where everyone stands.
Every year we put out the State of Spring survey, 
with respondents hailing from around the world and from organizations of every size and stripe. 
This year's results are even more interesting and exciting than the last!
 (You might even say they're awesome.)
